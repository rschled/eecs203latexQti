class ParsedMacroArgs(object):
    r"""
    Parsed representation of macro arguments.

    The base class provides a simple way of storing the arguments as a list of
    parsed nodes.

    This base class can be subclassed to store additional information and
    provide more advanced APIs to access macro arguments for certain categories
    of macros.

    Arguments:

      - `argnlist` is a list of latexwalker nodes that represent macro
        arguments.  If the macro arguments are too complicated to store in a
        list, leave this as `None`.  (But then code that uses the latexwalker
        must be aware of your own API to access the macro arguments.)

        The difference between `argnlist` and the legacy `nodeargs` is that all
        options, regardless of optional or mandatory, are stored in the list
        `argnlist` with possible `None`\ 's at places where optional arguments
        were not provided.  Previously, whether a first optional argument was
        included in `nodeoptarg` or `nodeargs` depended on how the macro
        specification was given.

      - `argspec` is a string or a list that describes how each corresponding
        argument in `argnlist` represents.  If the macro arguments are too
        complicated to store in a list, leave this as `None`.  For standard
        macros and parsed arguments this is a string with characters '*', '[',
        '{' describing an optional star argument, an optional
        square-bracket-delimited argument, and a mandatory argument.

    Attributes:

    .. py:attribute:: argnlist

       The list of latexwalker nodes that was provided to the constructor

    .. py:attribute:: argspec

       Argument type specification provided to the constructor

    .. py:attribute:: legacy_nodeoptarg_nodeargs

       A tuple `(nodeoptarg, nodeargs)` that should be exposed as properties in
       :py:class:`~p1.latexwalker.LatexMacroNode` to provide (as best as
       possible) compatibility with p1 < 2.

       This is either `(<1st optional arg node>, <list of remaining args>)` if
       the first argument is optional and all remaining args are mandatory; or
       it is `(None, <list of args>)` for any other argument structure.
