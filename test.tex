\probheadernum{correct SAMC}

This is a question is has math in it such as $\Sigma_{i=1}^0 P(\rho) \rightarrow A \cup B $,
it also has a line break\\
And some dedicated math lines:
\[\exists x f(x) \lor g(x) \leftrightarrow p(x) \equiv i \in [0,5) \]

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item answer choice 1
    \item answer choice 2
    \item choice 3
    \item you get the picture
    \item we usually have 5 but there could be
    \item more!
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
the answers are (b) $\Phi \times Y$ a surrounded by text and math
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}
the answers are (b) $\Phi \times Y$ and this other answer (c) and they are kinda surrounded by text and math
