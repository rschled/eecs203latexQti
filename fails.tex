Consider 3 red balls and 5 blue balls arranged on a line from left to right. How many different orderings of balls are there on this line if each red ball must have a blue ball immediately to its right? Balls of the same color are indistinguishable.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item  5

	\item  10

	\item  20

	\item  40

	\item  120

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

B
\\
Each pair of (red, blue) becomes an entity (there are 3 of these). There are 2 remaining blue balls. The number of orderings of these 5 entities is $5!/(3! \cdot 2!)=120/(6 \cdot 2)=10$. Another way to view this problem is choosing where to put the 2 single blue balls among the 5 available spots, which is $\binom{5}{2} = 10$.

What is the coefficient for the $m^{50} n^{51}$ term in the binomial expansion of $(3m-n)^{101}$
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item  $-(3^{51})\binom{101}{51}$ 
    
	\item  $-(3^{50})\binom{101}{50}$
    
	\item  $3^{50}\binom{101}{51}$ 
    
	\item  $3^{51}\binom{101}{50}$  

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

B
\\
The binomial expansion is $\sum_{k=0}^{101}\binom{101}{k}(3m)^{k}(-n)^{101-k}$. Expanding this, we get $\sum_{k=0}^{101}(-1)^{101-k}3^{k}m^kn^{101-k}$. The term asked for is when $k = 50$, so plugging that into the coefficient, we get $\binom{101}{50}(-1)^{51}3^{50} = -(3^{50})\binom{101}{50}$.

This is stars n' bars, with 7 stars and $26-1=25$ bars. There are $\binom{stars+bars}{stars} = \binom{7+25}{7}=\binom{32}{7}$ ways to create a group of 7 letters. You can also think about this problem as putting 7 indistinguishable objects in 26 distinguishable boxes.

We need to assign 4 students (A, B, C, and D) to 3 different teams (Team 1, Team 2, and Team 3). Each team needs to have at least 1 student. A and B cannot be in the same team. How many different ways are there to assign the teams?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

	\item  24

	\item  36

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

\\
We need to put the 4 students into 3 groups and each group needs to have at least 1 student. This means two of the students need to be in the same team.  There are $C(4, 2)=6$ ways to select two students who will be on the same team. However, A and B cannot be in the same team, so there are $6-1=5$ ways to select the pair of students who will on the same team. We now have 3 groups of 1, 1, and 2 students, and we assign the 3 groups to 3 teams, so there are in total $5 \cdot P(3, 3)= 5 \cdot 3! = 30$ ways.

Consider a relation $R$ on the set of all sets, where two sets $A$ and $B$ are related via $R$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ have at least 3 elements in common. Which properties hold for this relation?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

	\item  Symmetric
    
	\item  Antisymmetric
    
	\item  Transitive

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

\\
$R$ is not reflexive, because there is only 1 element in the intersection of a set of size 1 with
itself. $R$ is not antisymmetric; for example $\{1,2,3,4\}$ is related to $\{1,2,3\}$, but they are not the same set. $R$ is not transitive, because \{1, 2, 3, 4\} is related to \{1, 2, 3\} and \{2, 3, 4\} which are
not related, and $R$ is symmetric because $A \cap B$ = $B \cap A$.

The intersection of "red die came up as a 3" and "at least one of the two dice came up as 3" should be still "red die came up as a 3", which means $P(A \cap R) = P(R)$. For (a), $P(A|R) = P(A \cap R)/P(R) = P(R)/P(R) = 1$. For (b), $P(R|A) = P(A \cap R)/P(A) = P(R)/P(A) \neq P(R)$.

% Team 2, Question 5
\textit{Reminders:} A standard deck has 52 cards with 4 suits ($\heartsuit, \diamondsuit, \clubsuit, \spadesuit$) and 13 ranks (2, 3, \dots, 10, Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K), Ace (A)). \\

Joseph randomly draws a hand of $13$ cards from a standard deck of cards. What is the probability of his hand contains exactly two Aces?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item  $\frac{4\cdot3\cdot\binom{48}{11}}{\binom{52}{13}}$

	\item  $\frac{\binom{4}{2}\cdot\binom{48}{11}}{\binom{52}{13}}$

	\item  $\left(\frac{4}{52}\right)^2\cdot\left(\frac{48}{52}\right)^{11}$

	\item  $\left(\frac{4}{52}\right)^2\cdot\left(\frac{48}{52}\right)^{11}\cdot(13)!$

	\item  $\left(\frac{4}{52}\right)^2\cdot\left(\frac{48}{52}\right)^{11}\cdot\binom{13}{2}$

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

(b)\\
The size of the sample space is the number of ways to choose $13$ cards out of $52$ cards, which is $\binom{52}{13}$. The task of drawing $13$ cards with exactly two Aces can be viewed as the cascade of drawing $2$ Aces out of $4$ Aces and drawing $11$ non-Aces out of $48$ non-Aces. By the product rule, the size of the event is $\binom{4}{2}\cdot\binom{48}{11}$. Since we assume random drawing, all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely, the probability is $\frac{\binom{4}{2}\cdot\binom{48}{11}}{\binom{52}{13}}$.

	\item  $\frac{\binom{52}{19}\cdot\binom{4}{1}\cdot42!}{52!}$

	\item  $\frac{(48!/29!)\cdot32!\cdot4}{52!}$

	\item  $\frac{51!\cdot4}{52!}$

	\item  $\frac{(48!/29!)\cdot4}{52!}$

	\item  $(\frac{48}{52})^{19}\cdot\frac{4}{52}$

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

(b)\\
The sample space is all the possible permutations of 52 cards. The event is the set of permutations that the first king occurs at the 20th position. The first 19 positions must not have rank of king, and hence $\frac{48!}{29!}$ ways to form the first 19 positions. 4 options at the 20th position because each rank can take on 4 possible suits. The arrangement of the rest of 32 cards has no constraint, and there are 32! ways to form the remaining 32 positions.

In the binomial expansion of $(1/x^2 + x)^{15}$, what is the coefficient of the term $x^7$?

	\item  $15 \choose 7$
    
	\item  $15 \choose 5$
    
	\item  $15 \choose 9$
    
	\item  1

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

(a)\\
Expand the expression
\begin{align*}
(x^{-2} + x)^{15}  =& \sum_{k=0}^{15} {15\choose k}{(x^{-2})}^k {x}^{15-k} \\
=& \sum_{k=0}^{15} {15\choose k}x^{-2k} x^{15-k} \\
=& \sum_{k=0}^{15} {15\choose k}x^{-2k+15-k} \\
=& \sum_{k=0}^{15} {15\choose k}x^{15-3k}\\
\end{align*}
Since the non-zero terms in the expansion have exponents that are multiples of 3, the coefficient for $x^7$ is 0.

% Team 2, Question 3
How many 52 letter non-decreasing strings are there when the letters are chosen with repetition from the 26-letter English alphabet (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)?\\
(Note: Non-decreasing means that a letter at a latter position can only be the same or greater than its former letter, so a string of ``aabxzzzz" would be valid, whereas ``a\textbf{\underline{db}}" would not be valid.)\\
\textit{Hint:} Consider how you can use stars and bars to solve this.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item  $\binom{52}{26}$

	\item  $\binom{77}{51}$

	\item  $26^{52}$

	\item  $\binom{77}{25}$

	\item  $\binom{78}{51}$

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

(d)\\
This boils down to a Stars and Bars problem. We just need to choose the letters of the string, since once we have letters there is exactly one way to make a valid string (arrange the letters in a non-decreasing order). We have 25 bars coming from the 26 possible letter choices. Each letter in the string is a star that fits into one of the letter boxes. We have $\binom{\text{stars+bars}}{\text{stars}}=\binom{25+52}{25}=\binom{77}{25}$ possible strings.

There are 50 participants in a TV show. The host of the show will distribute three identical prizes among the participants by spinning a wheel that has numbers 1 through 50 on it three times. How many ways are there to distribute the prizes?

	\item  $\binom{52}{49}$
    
	\item  $\binom{50}{3}$

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

(d) \\
Note that any individual can win anywhere between 0 and 3 prizes, inclusive (repetition). By stars n' bars, we see that there are 3 stars and 49 bars. Since the prizes are identical (indistinguishable) then we treat the prizes as stars, and the participants are distinguishable and are used to calculate bars as $50 - 1 = 49$. Thus, there are $\binom{52}{3} = \binom{52}{49}$ ways to award the prizes.

This is because for red balls and blue balls, it's possible that they are distributed evenly among the three boxes. However, for green balls, there are 4 balls but only 3 boxes, so using the pigeonhole principle, $\lceil \frac{4}{3} \rceil = 2$. \\
For any value of $ x > 3$ (ex. 4), we can't apply pigeonhole principle because the number of boxes are greater or equal to the number of balls of each color.

When the first term is raised to the 15th power and the second term is raised to the 10th power, the $x$ term disappears and we are left with $y^{25}$. Thus, the coefficient is $\binom{25}{10}3^{15}\cdot 5^{10}=\binom{25}{15}3^{15}\cdot 5^{10}$

Let $R$ be a relation over the set of all sets. For sets $A$ and $B$, let ${}_A R_B$ if and only if $A - B$ is finite. Which of the following are true about $R$?
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item reflexive
    \item symmetric
    \item antisymmetric
    \item transitive
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(a), (d)\\
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item True; For every set $A$, $A - A = \emptyset$ and since the empty set is finite, then R is reflexive.
    \item False; Choose $A = \mathbb{Z^+}$ and $B = \mathbb{Z}$. Then ${}_A R_B$ because $A - B = \emptyset$, but $\neg {}_B R_A$ because $B - A = \mathbb{Z^-} \cup \{0\}$ which is countable infinite (not finite).
    \item False; Choose $A = \{1\}$ and $B = \{2\}$. Then ${}_A R_B$ because $A - B = \{1\}$ which is finite and ${}_B R_A$ because $B - A = \{2\}$ which is finite, but $A \neq B$.
    \item True; For arbitrary sets $A, B, C$, suppose that ${}_A R_B$ and ${}_B R_C$. We would like to show that ${}_A R_C$. Since ${}_A R_B$ then $A - B = A \cap \overline{B}$ is finite and since ${}_B R_C$ then $B - C = B \cap \overline{C}$ is finite. Then because the union of 2 finite sets must also be finite, we investigate and simplify $(A \cap \overline{B}) \cup (B \cap \overline{C}) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup \overline{C}) \cap (\overline{B} \cup \overline{C})$.\\
    If ${}_A R_C$, it would have to be true that $A - C = A \cap \overline{C}$ is finite. This can be proven by showing that $A \cap \overline{C} \subseteq (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup \overline{C}) \cap (\overline{B} \cup \overline{C})$. For any arbitrary $x \in A \cap \overline{C}$, $x \in A$ and $x \in \overline{C}$ by definition of set intersection. Since $x \in A$, then we know $x \in A$ or $x \in B$, so $x \in A \cup B$ and we know $x \in A$ or $x \in \overline{C}$, so $x \in A \cup \overline{C}$ by definition of set union. Also, since $x \in \overline{C}$, then we know $x \in \overline{B}$ or $x \in \overline{C}$, so $x \in \overline{B} \cup \overline{C}$. Thus, $x \in (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup \overline{C}) \cap (\overline{B} \cup \overline{C})$, so $A \cap \overline{C} \subseteq (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup \overline{C}) \cap (\overline{B} \cup \overline{C})$. Therefore, $A \cap \overline{C} = A - C$ must be finite, so ${}_A R_C$, which proves that R must be transitive.

    \begin{align*}
        n^n &\leq C \cdot n!\\

\emph{Reminders}: A standard deck has 52 cards, with 4 suits ($\heartsuit, \diamondsuit, \clubsuit, \spadesuit
$) and 13 ranks (2, 3, \dots, 10, J, Q, K, A).\\

\noindent
How many different 8-card poker hands have 3 cards that share a rank, 3 cards that share a different rank, and 2 cards that share another rank? For example, your hand may contain $2\heartsuit, 2\diamondsuit, 2\clubsuit, 5\spadesuit, 5\diamondsuit, 5\heartsuit,\text{J}\spadesuit,\text{J}\heartsuit$.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item  $\binom{13}{3}\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 4\cdot 6{}$

	\item  $\frac{13\cdot 12\cdot 11\cdot\binom{4}{3}\binom{4}{3}\binom{4}{2}}{6}$

	\item  $\frac{52\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 48\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 44\cdot 3}{6\cdot 6\cdot 2\cdot 2}$

	\item  $\binom{13}{2}\binom{11}{1}\binom{4}{2}4^2$

	\item  $13\cdot 12\cdot 44 \cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 4$

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

(a) (c) (d)
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item This is first choosing all the ranks then picking 1 of the 3 as the rank of the 2 cards of the same rank. Then we have 4 ways to choose one suit to not be in the hand for each of the groups of 3 cards that share a rank. And similarly for the other rank. Then $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the 2 suits for the 2 cards of a rank.
\item This divides out too much. The only overcounting occurs with the $13\cdot 12$, thus we would only have to divide out 2 and not 6.
\item This is just picking all the cards separately then dividing out all the overcounting, we must divide by 6 twice then 2 twice, as the first 3 cards can be selected in any order and then the order of the ranks for the first 6 cards can be reversed (a divide by 2). Then again the order of the last 2 cards can be reversed, thus we must again divide by 2 there.
\item This is just picking 2 ranks for the groups 3 cards that share a rank, then picking a rank for the 2 cards that share a rank, then picking 2 suits for the 2 cards that share a rank and $\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to pick 3 suits for each of the two remaining ranks.
\item This is picking a rank for the 3 cards that share a rank, then picking another rank for the 3 cards that share a rank. We are overcounting, because the order doesn't matter, thus we must divide out by 2. Then from the remaining 44 cards, picking a card then picking another card of the same rank. Again we are overcounting and must divide out by 2, because the order we select the cards doesn't matter. After we have 4 choices to select the one card of the rank that is not in our hand. This occurs two times (once for each rank of 3 cards of a kind). Thus the $2\cdot 2$ is never divided out, so we are overcounting.

    \item $Q_4$ has more vertices than $W_8$

\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
(b), (d)\\
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item False; $K_5$ is not bipartite since $K_5$ contains triangles which are cycles of odd length and any time a graph contains a cycle of odd length, the graph cannot be bipartite.
    \item True; $C_{60}$ is bipartite because $60$ is even and any $C_{n}$ with even $n$ is bipartite by assigning one vertex a color and then alternating colors at every vertex along the cycle.
    \item False; The maximum possible edges in a bipartite graph with $2n$ vertices is $n^2$. This is because we must partition our set of vertices into two sets where no vertices within the same set are connected by an edge. When this is true, we maximize the number of edges by having every edge possible between vertices in separate sets. So if $k$ is the number of vertices in one partition, then $2n - k$ is the number in the other partition, creating a maximum of $k(2n - k)$ edges. This product is maximized when $k = n$, producing $n^2$ edges at maximum. Therefore, if we have 14 vertices in a bipartite graph, then we have a maximum of 49 edges.
    \item True; $Q_4$ has $2^4 = 16$ vertices, whereas $W_8$ only has $8 + 1 = 9$ vertices.
    \item False; A directed multigraph with $n$ vertices \textit{might} have more edges than a simple graph with $n$ vertices but it also might not. For example, let $G_1 = K_4$. $G_1$ is simple graph with 4 vertices and $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ edges. Now let $G_2$ be a directed multigraph with 4 vertices and 0 edges. Then $G_1$ and $G_2$ have the same number of vertices, but $G_1$ has more edges than $G_2$.

$Cheering$ calls itself 3 times, each with an input size of $n/2$. Outside of the recursive calls, $Cheering$ executes the print statement inside the nested for loops. The inner loop executes $n$ times for each index of the outer loop, and the outer loop executes 5 times, so \textit{``you got this!"} is printed $5n$ times.
Putting it all together, the complexity of the algorithm, based on the number of print statements, is:
$T(n) = 3T(n/2) + 5n$.\\

 Using the Master Theorem, we can see that $a = 3, b = 2, d = 1$, so $\frac{a}{b^d} = 3/2 > 1$. Therefore, the complexity of this function is $=\Theta(n^{\log_b a})= \Theta(n^{\log_2 3})$

Of the $5^2 = 25$ potential  edges between elements of $A$, we know that 5 must be in the relation since our relation must be reflexive. That is, of the 25 possible ordered pairs that could be in the relation, we know that all 5 pairs of the form $(x,x)$ must be in the relation in order for it to be reflexive. For the remaining 20 potential ordered pairs, each pair could either be in the relation or not in the relation, giving  $2^{20}$ possible relations.

We can implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm on (108, 25) to answer all parts of this problem.
    \begin{align*}
        108-4\cdot 25 &=8 &\\
        25 -3 \cdot 8 &= 1 & \text{so} \gcd(108,25)=1\\
        \text{Working back up: }\\
        1&= 25-3\cdot 8 \\
         &= 25 - 3(108 - 4 \cdot 25) \\
         &= -3\cdot 108 +13 \cdot 25 \\
    \end{align*}
    

Looking at $1= -3\cdot 108 +13 \cdot 25$ in (mod 108), we get $1 \equiv 13 \cdot 25$ (mod 108) from which we observe that 13 and 25 are inverses in (mod 108).

If graph $A = K_8$, graph $B = K_{10}$, and graphs $A$ and $B$ share exactly 5 vertices, then how many edges are in $A \cup B$?

\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item 26
    \item 36
    \item 63
    \item 68
    \item 73
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
(c)

Using the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion, we are able to compute the number of edges in the union of the two graphs:

$|E_{A \cup B}| = |E_A| + |E_B| - |E_{A \cap B}|$

Since each of graphs A, B, and $A \cap B$ are complete graphs, then the number of edges in each individual graph on the RHS is equal to the number of vertices choose 2, or in other words, $\frac{v \cdot (v - 1)}{2}$ where v equals the number of vertices in each graph. Therefore, $|E_{A \cup B}| = \frac{8 \cdot 7}{2} + \frac{10 \cdot 9}{2} - \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 28 + 45 - 10 = 63$

Which of the following posets have a greatest element?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item  
    $(S, |)$, where $S = \{2, 3, 5, 10\}$.
    
	\item  
    $(S, |)$, where $S = \{2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 20, 60 \}$.
    
	\item  
    $(S, \leq)$, where $S = \{x \in \Q: 0 \leq x^2 \leq 3\}$.
    
	\item  
    $(\mathcal{P}(\R), \subseteq)$

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

(b), (d).

(a) has two maximal elements (3,10) and thus has no greatest element.

(b) has only one maximal element, so it has a greatest element.

(c) has no maximal element as $\sqrt{3}$ is not a rational number, so it does not have a greatest element.

(d) has one maximal element which is $\R$, so it has a greatest element.

Given sets $A$, $B$, and $C$ such that $|A| = 3, |B| = 6$, and $|C| = 8$, which of the following \textbf{could be true}? Select all that apply.


\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item $|A \cap C| = 8$
    \item $|(C - B) \times A| = 9$
    \item $B$ is the power set of $A$
    \item $C$ is the power set of $A$
    \item $\left( (A \times B) \cap C \neq \varnothing \right) \wedge \left( A \cap C \neq \varnothing \right)$
\end{enumerate}


\begin{solution}
(b), (d), (e)

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

(b), (d), (e)

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $A \cap C = 8$ cannot be true since the maximum number of terms in the intersection of two sets is equal to the minimum cardinality of the two sets which in this case is 3.
    \item
    Secondly, if $|(C - B) \times A| = 9$ is true, then $|(C - B)| = 3$ since $|A| = 3$. This can be true if 5 of the 6 elements of set B are included in set C meaning that $|(C - B)| = 8 - 5 = 3$. This means that answer (b) can be correct.
    \item
    $B = P(A)$ is not possible since $6 \neq 2^3$.
    \item
    $C = P(A)$ could be true since the number of terms in a power set of a set is $2^n$ and $8 = 2^3$ therefore it is possible. So answer (d) could be correct.
    \item
    When considering $(A \times B)  \cap C  \neq \varnothing \wedge A \cap C \neq \varnothing$, let us consider the following: $\{1, (1,2)\} \subset A, \{2\} \subset b$, and $\{(1,2)\} \subset C$. This would mean that $\{(1,2)\} \subset (A \times B)$ and therefore that $\{(1,2)\} \subset (A \times B) \cap C$. Now considering the second part of the statement, $\{(1,2)\} \subset A$ meaning that $\{(1,2)\} \subset A \cap C$. With these two examples together, we have shown that answer (e) can be correct.

5 people want to play doubles ping-pong. They are going to split up into two pairs, and one of them will referee the game. How many different ways are there to set up the game?

(a)\\
choose the referee $\binom{5}{1}$, then select two players who will be on a team $\binom{4}{2}$ and select the other two remaining who will be on a team $\binom{2}{2}$. Then we divide by $2!$ because we overcount the case we choose AB then CD and the case we choose CD and then AB since they both set up the game the same way.

Out in 3D space, we have coordinates in the $x, y,$ and $z$ dimension. We have a spaceship that can only move in three possible directions, one coordinate unit at a time: towards \textbf{positive} $x, y,$ or $z$. 

In other words, if we are at location $(x,y,z)$, there are 3 locations we can travel to next:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(x+1,y,z)$
    \item $(x,y+1,z)$

There are $2$ options for each flavor of ice cream (in/out) and there are $6$ flavors of ice cream. However, we are overcounting the scenario of all $6$ flavors being out since Brian has to buy at least $1$ pint of ice cream, so we subtract $1$.

	\item  The number of ways to assign rankings of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd to a group of seven competitors.

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

% Team 2.3
(a), (b), (e) \\
(a) is correct because this is equal to the number of bit strings of length seven that contain exactly three 1s. (Also, C(7,3) = C(7,4).) \\
(b) can be found with the stars and bars method. There are 3 stars (number of candy bars) and 4 bars (number of children minus one). Then, we have C(stars + bars, stars), which will give us C(7,3). \\
(c) is incorrect because this would be choosing ordered arrangements. \\
(d) is incorrect because the number of possible outcomes that contain \textbf{at least} three heads is equal to C(7,3) + C(7,4) + C(7,5) + C(7,6) + C(7,7). \\
(e) is correct because the only way this can happen is if there are four heads and three tails, which would give us C(7,3).

What is the constant term in the expansion of $(203x^2+376\frac{1}{x})^{300}$ ?

    \item $\binom{300}{100} \cdot 203^{100} \cdot 376^{200}$

\begin{solution}
% Hw Team 2
(a) The constant term must have the $x^2$ and $\frac{1}{x}$ cancel out. This happens when there is a $(203x^2)^{100}$ and $(376\frac{1}{x})^{200}$ in the term. Using the binomial expansion formula, the term is $$\binom{300}{100}(203x^2)^{100}(376\frac{1}{x})^{200} = \binom{300}{100}203^{100}376^{200}$$

A fair coin is flipped 6 times in a row. Given that the fourth flip is tails, what is the probability that exactly 4 flips come up heads?
\\
\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item $\frac{1}{64}$
    \item $\frac{1}{32}$
    \item $\frac{5}{32}$
    \item $\frac{15}{64}$
    \item $\frac{15}{32}$

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
% Team 3 
c) Because the fourth flip is tails, we are looking for the probability that exactly 4 of the other 5 flips come up heads. This probability can be found using the binomial distribution. We have $n = 5$, and $k = 4$, and $p = 1 - p = 1/2$ (because the coin is fair). Thus, we know that the probability is $\binom{5}{4}(1/2)^4(1/2)^1 = \frac{5}{32}$

After repeatedly rolling 2 identical standard dice, you finally notice that a combination has repeated itself. For example, on the second roll, you roll a 1 and a 5, and on the eighth roll, you roll a 5 and a 1.  How many rolls of 2 dice are required to guarantee that some unordered combination has been repeated?

(d) There are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose, in no particular order, two distinct numbers, and another 6 ways to choose two repeated numbers. This means there are $15 + 6 = 21$ distinct die rolls and thus there must be 22 rolls of 2 dice in order to guarantee that some combination has been repeated.

Six identical prizes are to be given to 12 chefs in a local cook-off. Nevertheless, any individual chef may win anywhere between 0 and 6 prizes, inclusive. How many ways are there to award the chefs the prizes?
\begin{enumerate}[{(a)}]
    \item $\frac{12^6}{6!}$
    \item $12^6$

    \item $\frac{12!}{6!}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
% Hw Team 2
(d) By stars n' bars, we see that there are 6 stars and 11 bars. Since the prizes are identical (indistinguishable) then we treat the prizes as stars, and the chefs are distinguishable and are used to calculate bars as $12 - 1 = 11$. Thus, there are $\binom{17}{6} = \binom{17}{11}$ ways to award the chefs the prizes.

Computer programs print output to a screen, and sometimes when multiple programs try to print output at the same time, the individual characters get interleaved, while maintaining their original order from within their respective programs. For example, if Program A prints \textbf{abc} and Program B prints \textbf{DEF}, the output may be \textbf{aDbcEF}, but never \textbf{cbaDEF}.

\vspace{0.1in}
If Program 1 prints \textbf{RISHI}, Program 2 prints \textbf{ADAM}, and Program 3 prints\\ \textbf{ELLEN}, how many possible interleavings are there?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item  $\frac{14!}{2!2!2!2!}$
    
	\item  $\frac{14!}{8!}$
    
	\item  $\binom{14}{5} \binom{9}{4}$
    
	\item  $\frac{1}{2!2!2!2!} \binom{14}{5} \binom{9}{4}$
    
	\item  $\frac{1}{8!}\binom{14}{5} \binom{9}{4}$

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
 
%Hw Team 2
(c)

There are
\[
    \binom{14}{5} \binom{9}{4}
\]
ways to choose the interleavings, since you first choose the 5 spots for the 5 characters printed by program 1, then choose the 4 spots for the 4 characters printed by program 2. This is because once the spots are chosen, the order of the letters printed by the program is predetermined. 

Note that no overcounting occurs, since the words were chosen carefully so that there is no overlap between the output of the 3 programs. Even though there are two "$i$"s in $rishi$, each $i$ is placed uniquely by the choice of the spots for $rishi$, so no overcounting occurs.

Which of the following sets are well-ordered under the given ordering?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item  ($\mathbb{Q^+} \cup \{0\}$, $<$)

	\item  ($\mathbb{R} \cap \mathbb{N}$, $<$)

	\item  $(\Z^-, <)$

	\item  ($\{\pi, 1, \sqrt{2}, -5\}$, $>$)

	\item  $([0,1], >)$

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

(b), (d)\\
(a) is not well ordered because there is a nonempty subset (e.g. $\mathbb{Q^+}$) that has no least element.\\
(b) is well ordered since this reduces to $\mathbb{N}$ which is well-ordered under $<$.\\
(c) is not well ordered because there is a nonempty subset (e.g. $\mathbb{Z^-}$) that has no least element.\\
(d) is well ordered because every nonempty subset has a least element and a defined ordering.\\
(e) is not well ordered because there is a nonempty subset (e.g. (0, 1)) that has no least element.
