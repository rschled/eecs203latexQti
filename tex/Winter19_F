How many ways are there to pair up 6 dogs with 6 different dog leashes, where each pair consists of a dog with a leash?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
% Hw Team 3
\item 6!
\item $2^6$
\item $(6!)^2$
\item $\binom{6+5}{6}$
\item $\binom{12}{2}\binom{10}{2}\binom{8}{2}\binom{6}{2}\binom{4}{2}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(a) \\
This is essentially assigning every dog a leash. The first dog can have 6 choices for a leash to pair with, the second dog has 5 choices and so on. Thus we have $6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1=6!$
\end{solution}

What is the big-$\Theta$ of the following algorithm, based on the number of print statements?

% See: http://mirror.hmc.edu/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/algorithm2e/doc/algorithm2e.pdf

        }

         \Cheering{$n/2$}\;
         \KwRet{}
     }
     \caption{Cheering}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\Theta(n)$
\item $\Theta(n^2)$
\item $\Theta(n^2\log(n))$
\item $\Theta(n \log(n^2))$
\item $\Theta(n^{\log_2 3})$
\end{enumerate}


\begin{solution}
% Hw Team 4
(e)\\
$Cheering$ calls itself 3 times, each with an input size of $n/2$. Outside of the recursive calls, $Cheering$ executes the print statement inside the nested for loops. The inner loop executes $n$ times for each index of the outer loop, and the outer loop executes 5 times, so \textit{``you got this!"} is printed $5n$ times.
Putting it all together, the complexity of the algorithm, based on the number of print statements, is:
$T(n) = 3T(n/2) + 5n$.\\

 Using the Master Theorem, we can see that $a = 3, b = 2, d = 1$, so $\frac{a}{b^d} = 3/2 > 1$. Therefore, the complexity of this function is $=\Theta(n^{\log_b a})= \Theta(n^{\log_2 3})$
\end{solution}

Let A be a set such that $|A| = 5$. How many relations over $A$ are reflexive? 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 5
    \item $2^{25} - 5 \cdot 2^{24}$
    \item $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{20} \binom{25}{k}$ 
    \item $2^{11}$
    \item $2^{20}$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
% HW TEAM 2
(e) \\
Of the $5^2 = 25$ potential  edges between elements of $A$, we know that 5 must be in the relation since our relation must be reflexive. That is, of the 25 possible ordered pairs that could be in the relation, we know that all 5 pairs of the form $(x,x)$ must be in the relation in order for it to be reflexive. For the remaining 20 potential ordered pairs, each pair could either be in the relation or not in the relation, giving  $2^{20}$ possible relations.

What is the remainder when $9^{102}$ is divided by 11?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 2
    \item 4
    \item 6
    \item 8
    \item 10
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
(b)
Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we note that  $9^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$, so:
\begin{align*}
    9^{102} &=9^{100} \cdot 9^2 \\
    &= (9^{10})^{10} \cdot 9^2 \\
    &\equiv (1)^{10}  \cdot 9^2  \pmod{11}\\
    &\equiv 81 \pmod{11}\\
    &\equiv 4 \pmod{11}
\end{align*}

Alternatively, since $9^5 \equiv (-2)^5 \equiv -32 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$, we get
$$(9^5)^{20} \equiv (1)^{20} \mod 11$$
$$9^{100} \equiv 1 \mod 11$$
$$9^{102} \equiv 9^2 \cdot 9^{100} \equiv 81 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}$$
Thus $9^{102} \equiv 4 \mod 11$, so the remainder is 4.

You roll a fair 6-sided die  until a 5 or a 6 comes up or you've rolled three times. For example, if you roll (3, 5) you roll a total of 2 times, and if you roll (3, 3, 4) you roll a total of 3 times. Let $X$ be the number of times you roll the die. Find $E(X)$.\\



\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\frac{11}{9}$
\item $\frac{5}{3}$
\item 2
\item $\frac{19}{9}$
\item 3
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution} 
%New problem, hw team 3???
(d)

Let $F_i$ be the event of rolling a 5 or a 6 on the $i$-th roll. Since each roll is independent, $p(F_i)=2/6=1/3$, for $i=1,2,3$. $X \in \{1,2,3\}$. Note that if we do not roll a 5 or a 6 on either the first roll or the second roll, then $X=3$ regardless of what comes up on the third roll.\\
$p(X=1) = p(F_1) = 1/3$\\
$p(X=2) = p(\overline{F_1}\cap F_2) = p(\overline{F_1})\cdot p(F_2) = 2/3 \cdot 1/3 = 2/9$.\\
$p(X=3) = p(\overline{F_1}\cap \overline{F_2})=p(\overline{F_1})\cdot p(\overline{F_2})=2/3 \cdot 2/3 = 4/9.$
\begin{align*}
   E(X) &= 1\cdot p(X=1) + 2 \cdot p(X=2) + 3 \cdot p(X=3)  \\
   &= 1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 2 \cdot \frac{2}{9} + 3 \cdot \frac{4}{9} \\
   &= \frac{3}{9}+\frac{4}{9} + \frac{12}{9} \\
   &= \frac{19}{9}
\end{align*}


(a) is the result if a student said $p(X=3) = p(\overline{F_1}\cap \overline{F_2}\cap F_3)$.\\
(b) is the result if a student said $p(X=3) = p(\overline{F_1}\cap \overline{F_2}\cap \overline{F_3})$.\\
(c) is the result if a student assigned equal probabilities to all values of $X$.\\
(e) is the result if a student used the Geometric distribution: $E(X) = 1/p = 3$.

\item TRUE. R is irreflexive means $\neg \exists a \in R$ such that $aRa$, and S is irreflexive means $\neg \exists b \in S$ such that $bSb$, so $\forall c \in R \cup S, (c, c) \notin R \cup S$, i.e. $R \cup S$ is irreflexive.
\item FALSE. For a counterexample, suppose $ A=\{1,2,3\} $, $ R = \{(1,2)\} $, $ S = \{(2,1)\} $. R and S are both asymmetric but $ R \cup S = \{(1,2), (2,1)\} $ is not asymmetric since $(1, 2) \in R \cup S \wedge (2, 1) \in R \cup S$.
\item TRUE. R is asymmetric means $(a, b) \in R \implies (b, a) \notin R$. For all (a, b) $\in$ R, removing (c, d) $\in S \cap R$ to get R - S cannot add (b, a) to R, so we still cannot have $(a, b) \in R \wedge (b, a) \in R$.
\item FALSE. For a counterexample, suppose $ A=\{1,2,3\} $, $ R = \{(1,2), (2, 3), (1, 3)\} $, $ S = \{(1, 3)\} $. R and S are both transitive but $ R - S = \{(1,2), (2,3)\} $ which is not transitive since (1, 2) $\in$ R - S $\wedge$ (2, 3) $\in$ R - S but (1, 3) $\notin$ R - S.

None of the above. $3x \equiv 10$ (mod 12) has no solutions. The only possible values of $3x$ in (mod 12) are \{0,3,6,9\}, thus $3x$ can never be 10.

Which of the following are true?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item gcd$(108,25) = 1$
\item $25x \equiv 29 \pmod{108}$ has a solution.
\item $25^{-1} \equiv -4$  (mod  108)
\item $25^{-1} \equiv 13$  (mod 108)
\item $25^{-1}$ does not exist  (mod $108$)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution} a, b, d

We can implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm on (108, 25) to answer all parts of this problem.
    \begin{align*}
        108-4\cdot 25 &=8 &\\
        25 -3 \cdot 8 &= 1 & \text{so} \gcd(108,25)=1\\
        \text{Working back up: }\\
        1&= 25-3\cdot 8 \\
         &= 25 - 3(108 - 4 \cdot 25) \\
         &= -3\cdot 108 +13 \cdot 25 \\
    \end{align*}
    

Looking at $1= -3\cdot 108 +13 \cdot 25$ in (mod 108), we get $1 \equiv 13 \cdot 25$ (mod 108) from which we observe that 13 and 25 are inverses in (mod 108).

Given the poset $(\{-3, 1, 2,  5, 12, 9, 36\}, |)$, which of the following statements are true?
