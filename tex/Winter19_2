How many numbers must be selected from the set of all integers to guarantee that at least 2 of the numbers are divisible by 100?
\begin{enumerate}[{(a)}]
% Hw Team 2
    \item 100
    \item 101
    \item 201
    \item 10,001
    \item This cannot be guaranteed 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
    (e) It is possible to keep selecting integers and have \textbf{none} of them be divisible by 100. Note that we cannot apply the Pigeon-hole Principle here. If the question was asking about numbers that have the same remainder when divided by 100, then we could use the PP to determine we need 101 integers to guarantee this. Remember that the PP guarantees that at least one hole has at least two pigeons, but can never guarantee the number of pigeons in a particular hole.
\end{solution}

What is the constant term in the expansion of $(203x^2+376\frac{1}{x})^{300}$ ?
\begin{enumerate}[{(a)}]
    \item $\binom{300}{100} \cdot 203^{100} \cdot 376^{200}$
    \item $\binom{300}{150} \cdot 203^{150} \cdot 376^{150}$
    \item $203^{100} \cdot 376^{200}$
    \item $203^{150} \cdot 376^{150}$
    \item 0
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
% Hw Team 2
(a) The constant term must have the $x^2$ and $\frac{1}{x}$ cancel out. This happens when there is a $(203x^2)^{100}$ and $(376\frac{1}{x})^{200}$ in the term. Using the binomial expansion formula, the term is $$\binom{300}{100}(203x^2)^{100}(376\frac{1}{x})^{200} = \binom{300}{100}203^{100}376^{200}$$
\end{solution}

Suppose you toss a fair coin 12 times resulting in a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). Let N be the number of times that the sequence HTHT appears.  For example, HTHT appears twice in $$\underline{\text{HT}\overline{\text{HT}}}\overline{\text{HT}}\text{TTTTTT}$$ Find E(N). 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\frac{1}{16}$
\item $\frac{3}{16}$
\item $\frac{9}{16}$
\item $\frac{5}{8}$
\item $\frac{3}{4}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
% Team 4
(c) You can break a sequence of 12 into 9 overlapping mini sequences, each of size 4. For each mini-sequence, the probability of getting HTHT is $(\frac{1}{2})^4=\frac{1}{16}$, so the expected number of times HTHT appears in a mini sequence is $E(X_i) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{16} + 0 \cdot \frac{15}{16} =\frac{1}{16} $. Now we can use linearity of expectation to find the expected number of times HTHT appears in the larger sequence. Recall that linearity of expectation does not require independence, so the fact that the mini-sequences overlap is irrelevant.  

$E(X) = E(X_1 + X_2 +...+X_9)= 9E(X_i) = \frac{9}{16}$.
\end{solution}

A fair coin is flipped 6 times in a row. Given that the fourth flip is tails, what is the probability that exactly 4 flips come up heads?
\\
\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item $\frac{1}{64}$
    \item $\frac{1}{32}$
    \item $\frac{5}{32}$
    \item $\frac{15}{64}$
    \item $\frac{15}{32}$

\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
% Team 3 
c) Because the fourth flip is tails, we are looking for the probability that exactly 4 of the other 5 flips come up heads. This probability can be found using the binomial distribution. We have $n = 5$, and $k = 4$, and $p = 1 - p = 1/2$ (because the coin is fair). Thus, we know that the probability is $\binom{5}{4}(1/2)^4(1/2)^1 = \frac{5}{32}$
\end{solution}

What is the flaw in the following induction proof?\\

Claim: $a^n=1$ for all nonnegative integers $n$, whenever $a$ is a nonzero real number.\\
Base case: $a^0=1$ is true by rules of exponents.\\
Inductive step: Assume that $a^j=1$ for all nonnegative integers $j$ with $j \leq k$. Then $$a^{k+1}=\frac{a^ka^k}{a^{k-1}}=\frac{1 \cdot 1}{1}=1$$

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The inductive proof is correct.
\item It fails to prove $P(0)$
\item It fails to prove $P(0)\rightarrow P(1)$
\item It fails to prove $P(1)\rightarrow P(2)$
\item It fails to prove $P(2)\rightarrow P(3)$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(c) The base case of $P(0)$ is true since $a^0$ is indeed equal to 1 for any nonzero real number $a$. If we assume the inductive hypothesis, $P(k)$, for any $k \geq $\textbf{1}, we can prove $P(k+1)$. However, the proof breaks down when we try to prove $P(0) \rightarrow P(1)$ because $a^{0+1} = \frac{a^0 a^0}{a^{0-1}}=\frac{1}{a^{-1}}=a$. In the denominator, we cannot assume by our inductive hypothesis that $a^{-1} = 1$ since this inductive hypothesis is only applicable to $a$ raised to a natural number, but $-1$ is not a natural number. Therefore, this proof fails to prove $P(0)\rightarrow P(1)$.
\end{solution}

After repeatedly rolling 2 identical standard dice, you finally notice that a combination has repeated itself. For example, on the second roll, you roll a 1 and a 5, and on the eighth roll, you roll a 5 and a 1.  How many rolls of 2 dice are required to guarantee that some unordered combination has been repeated?  
\begin{enumerate}[{(a)}]
    \item 13
    \item 16
    \item 19
    \item 22
    \item 37
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
% Hw Team 2
% TODO: Team 2 to update solution using stars and bars
(d) There are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose, in no particular order, two distinct numbers, and another 6 ways to choose two repeated numbers. This means there are $15 + 6 = 21$ distinct die rolls and thus there must be 22 rolls of 2 dice in order to guarantee that some combination has been repeated.
\end{solution}

Six identical prizes are to be given to 12 chefs in a local cook-off. Nevertheless, any individual chef may win anywhere between 0 and 6 prizes, inclusive. How many ways are there to award the chefs the prizes?
\begin{enumerate}[{(a)}]
    \item $\frac{12^6}{6!}$
    \item $12^6$
    \item $\binom{17}{5}$
    \item $\binom{17}{11}$
    \item $\frac{12!}{6!}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
% Hw Team 2
(d) By stars n' bars, we see that there are 6 stars and 11 bars. Since the prizes are identical (indistinguishable) then we treat the prizes as stars, and the chefs are distinguishable and are used to calculate bars as $12 - 1 = 11$. Thus, there are $\binom{17}{6} = \binom{17}{11}$ ways to award the chefs the prizes.
\end{solution}

6 green balls, 8 blue balls, and 3 red balls are placed in a bag. You are asked to select 3 balls from the bag without replacement. If the first ball you pick is green, what is the probability that after all three picks, you end up with at least two green balls?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
% Team 3
    \item $\frac{6 \cdot 5}{17 \cdot 16}$
    \item $\frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4}{17 \cdot 16 \cdot 15}$
    \item $1 - \frac{11 \cdot 10}{17 \cdot 16}$
    \item $1 - \frac{11 \cdot 10}{16 \cdot 15}$
    \item $\frac{5}{16}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

(d) 

We are looking for the probability of drawing at least 1 green ball on your last two draws. To find this, we can find the probability you pick no green balls on your last two draws, and subtract that from 1. The probability you don't pick a green ball on your second draw is the same as the probability of drawing a blue or red ball on your second draw, which is $\frac{11}{16}$. Because we are drawing without replacement, there are 16 total balls in the bag on draw 2. Similarly, we find the probability for not drawing a green ball on draw 3 to be $\frac{10}{15}$. Multiplying these two probabilities and subtracting from 1 gives us answer d.
\end{solution}

Computer programs print output to a screen, and sometimes when multiple programs try to print output at the same time, the individual characters get interleaved, while maintaining their original order from within their respective programs. For example, if Program A prints \textbf{abc} and Program B prints \textbf{DEF}, the output may be \textbf{aDbcEF}, but never \textbf{cbaDEF}.

\vspace{0.1in}
If Program 1 prints \textbf{RISHI}, Program 2 prints \textbf{ADAM}, and Program 3 prints\\ \textbf{ELLEN}, how many possible interleavings are there?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $\frac{14!}{2!2!2!2!}$
    \item $\frac{14!}{8!}$
    \item $\binom{14}{5} \binom{9}{4}$
    \item $\frac{1}{2!2!2!2!} \binom{14}{5} \binom{9}{4}$
    \item $\frac{1}{8!}\binom{14}{5} \binom{9}{4}$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution} 
%Hw Team 2
(c)

There are
\[
    \binom{14}{5} \binom{9}{4}
\]
ways to choose the interleavings, since you first choose the 5 spots for the 5 characters printed by program 1, then choose the 4 spots for the 4 characters printed by program 2. This is because once the spots are chosen, the order of the letters printed by the program is predetermined. 

Note that no overcounting occurs, since the words were chosen carefully so that there is no overlap between the output of the 3 programs. Even though there are two "$i$"s in $rishi$, each $i$ is placed uniquely by the choice of the spots for $rishi$, so no overcounting occurs.

Consider the following identity:
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} i=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{align*}
Which of the following approaches would be a valid way to show this?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Using arithmetic series identities
\item Using geometric series identities
\item Mathematical induction
\item Strong induction
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(a), (c), (d)
\\This identity can be proven with arithmetic series identities as it itself is an arithmetic series identity. Mathematical or strong induction can prove this identity with base case P(1) : 1 = $\frac{1 \cdot 2}{2}$. Inductive Hypothesis: P(k) : $\Sigma_{i=1}^ki=\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$. Inductive Step: assume P(k), show P(k+1) is true: $\Sigma_{i=1}^{k+1}i= \Sigma_{i=1}^{k}i + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2} = \frac{k^2 + k + 2k + 2}{2} = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} $. Geometric series identities would not be a valid way of proving the identity because they deal with a geometric series, not an arithmetic series.

\item $(\Z^-, <)$
\item ($\{\pi, 1, \sqrt{2}, -5\}$, $>$)
\item $([0,1], >)$

(a) is not well ordered because there is a nonempty subset (e.g. $\mathbb{Q^+}$) that has no least element.\\
(b) is well ordered since this reduces to $\mathbb{N}$ which is well-ordered under $<$.\\
(c) is not well ordered because there is a nonempty subset (e.g. $\mathbb{Z^-}$) that has no least element.\\
(d) is well ordered because every nonempty subset has a least element and a defined ordering.\\

You roll a fair five-sided die with faces 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Let $X$ be a random variable representing the number you roll. Which of the following statements are correct?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $p(X=3)=0.2$
\item $p(X>3)=0.4$
\item $E(X)=3$
\item $V(X)=3$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
(a), (b), (c)
Since the die is fair, then each face comes up with equal probability, therefore, $p(X=1)=p(X=2)=p(X=3)=p(X=4)=p(X=5)=0.2$. 
This explains answer (a). Answer (b) follows directly since $p(X>3) = p(X = 4) + p(X = 5) = .2 + .2 = .4$. \\\\Now to calculate $E(X)$, we see $E(X)= .2 \cdot 1 + .2 \cdot 2 + .2 \cdot 3 + .2 \cdot 4 + .2 \cdot 5 = 3$, thus (c) is correct. Finally, $V(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2$. $E(X^2) = .2 \cdot (1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25) = .2 \cdot (55) = 11$. Then $V(X) = 11 - 3^2 = 2$, so (d) is incorrect.

A river splits up into two branches, then recombines after a series of dams in each branch. As shown in the figure below, Branch A has two dams and Branch B has three dams.  At any particular time, each dam has a probability of $0.1$ of being lowered, and each dam is lowered independently of the others. Water can flow through only if at least one branch has all of its dams lowered. What is the probability that water can flow through?
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{river.png}

\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item $1 - 0.9^5$
    \item $0.1^3 + 0.1^2 - 0.1^5$
    \item $0.1^3 + 0.1^2$
    \item $0.1^5$
    \item $1 - (0.9^3 + 0.9^2)$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(b) 

Water can flow through if all the dams in branch A are lowered or all the dams in branch B are lowered. We now use inclusion-exclusion principle. The probability of any individual gate being lowered is $0.1$ and each gate is independent of the other gates, so we use product rule to find the following probabilities. The probability that the water can flow through branch A is $0.1^2$ and the probability that the water can flow through branch B is $0.1^3$.  The probability that water can flow through both branch A and B is $0.1^2 \cdot 0.1^3 = 0.1^5$. Thus, by inclusion-exclusion, answer (b) is correct.
