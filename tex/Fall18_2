Consider 3 red balls and 5 blue balls arranged on a line from left to right. How many different orderings of balls are there on this line if each red ball must have a blue ball immediately to its right? Balls of the same color are indistinguishable.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 5
\item 10
\item 20
\item 40
\item 120
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
B
\\
Each pair of (red, blue) becomes an entity (there are 3 of these). There are 2 remaining blue balls. The number of orderings of these 5 entities is $5!/(3! \cdot 2!)=120/(6 \cdot 2)=10$. Another way to view this problem is choosing where to put the 2 single blue balls among the 5 available spots, which is $\binom{5}{2} = 10$.
\end{solution}

What is the coefficient for the $m^{50} n^{51}$ term in the binomial expansion of $(3m-n)^{101}$
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $-(3^{51})\binom{101}{51}$ 
    \item $-(3^{50})\binom{101}{50}$
    \item $3^{50}\binom{101}{51}$ 
    \item $3^{51}\binom{101}{50}$  
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
B
\\
The binomial expansion is $\sum_{k=0}^{101}\binom{101}{k}(3m)^{k}(-n)^{101-k}$. Expanding this, we get $\sum_{k=0}^{101}(-1)^{101-k}3^{k}m^kn^{101-k}$. The term asked for is when $k = 50$, so plugging that into the coefficient, we get $\binom{101}{50}(-1)^{51}3^{50} = -(3^{50})\binom{101}{50}$. 
\end{solution}

Throw two fair dice. What is the probability the difference between the two numbers rolled is greater than 1?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $\frac{11}{36}$
    \item $\frac{7}{18}$
    \item $\frac{4}{9}$
    \item $\frac{5}{9}$
    \item $\frac{25}{36}$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
\bigskip
D
\\
Let E be the event that the difference between those two numbers is less than or equal to 1, i.e., the difference is 0 or 1. Of the 36 possible rolls, there are 6 rolls where the dice come up the same (e.g., (2,2)). For a difference of 1, we could have (1,2), (2,3),...,(5,6) or (2,1),(3,2),...,(6,5), so $2\cdot 5$ ways.\\
$|E| = 6+5 \cdot 2 = 16$\\
$P = 1 - P(E) = 1 - \frac{16}{6 \cdot 6} = \frac{5}{9}$
\end{solution}

How many ways are there to create an unordered group of 7 letters from the 26 English letters (lower-case only), where repetition is allowed?  
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item \text{\Large{$\frac{26!}{7!7!7!7!7!7!7!}$}}
    \item $\binom{26}{7}$
    \item $\binom{32}{7}$
    \item $\binom{33}{7}$
    \item $P(26, 7)$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
C
\\
This is stars n' bars, with 7 stars and $26-1=25$ bars. There are $\binom{stars+bars}{stars} = \binom{7+25}{7}=\binom{32}{7}$ ways to create a group of 7 letters. You can also think about this problem as putting 7 indistinguishable objects in 26 distinguishable boxes.
\end{solution}

Consider a set $S$ that contains all integers between 1 and 203 inclusive. What is the minimum number of distinct integers you can pick from set $S$ such that you are guaranteed that at least 2 of those numbers sum to 204?\\

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 2
\item 101
\item 102
\item 103
\item 202
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
D
\end{solution}

We need to assign 4 students (A, B, C, and D) to 3 different teams (Team 1, Team 2, and Team 3). Each team needs to have at least 1 student. A and B cannot be in the same team. How many different ways are there to assign the teams?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 6  
    \item 24 
    \item 30
    \item 36
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
C
\\
We need to put the 4 students into 3 groups and each group needs to have at least 1 student. This means two of the students need to be in the same team.  There are $C(4, 2)=6$ ways to select two students who will be on the same team. However, A and B cannot be in the same team, so there are $6-1=5$ ways to select the pair of students who will on the same team. We now have 3 groups of 1, 1, and 2 students, and we assign the 3 groups to 3 teams, so there are in total $5 \cdot P(3, 3)= 5 \cdot 3! = 30$ ways.

\end{solution}

Suppose we roll a fair die until we see a 2 and a 3 in no particular order. What is the expected value of the number of times we roll the die?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 6
\item 9
\item 12
\item 18
\item 24
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
B
\\
Let X = number of rolls to get the first 2 or 3. $p=1/3$, so $E(X)=3$.\\
Let Y = number of rolls to get the other number. $p=1/6$, so $E(Y)=6$.\\
$E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 3 + 6 = 9$.
%Let X = number of times we roll the dice get a 2 first and not 3 and then a 3, $E(X)= E(2) + E(3) = 3 + 6 = 9 $
%Let Y = number of times we roll the dice get a 3 first and not 2then a 2, $E(Y)= E(3) + E(2) = 3 + 6 = 9$
%total expected value
%\\ $E(X $ \cup $ Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 18 $

Consider a relation $R$ on the set of all sets, where two sets $A$ and $B$ are related via $R$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ have at least 3 elements in common. Which properties hold for this relation?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Reflexive
    \item Symmetric
    \item Antisymmetric
    \item Transitive
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
B
\\
$R$ is not reflexive, because there is only 1 element in the intersection of a set of size 1 with
itself. $R$ is not antisymmetric; for example $\{1,2,3,4\}$ is related to $\{1,2,3\}$, but they are not the same set. $R$ is not transitive, because \{1, 2, 3, 4\} is related to \{1, 2, 3\} and \{2, 3, 4\} which are
not related, and $R$ is symmetric because $A \cap B$ = $B \cap A$.
\end{solution}

Two fair six-sided dice are rolled, where one is red and one is blue. Let $R$ be the event that the red die came up as a 3, and let $A$ be the event that at least one of the two dice came up as 3. Which of the following are true?

\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item $P(A|R) = P(A)$
    \item $P(R|A) = P(R)$
    \item $P(A \cap R) = P(R)$
    \item $P(A) = \frac{1}{3}$
    \item $P(R) = \frac{1}{6}$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
C, E
\\
The intersection of "red die came up as a 3" and "at least one of the two dice came up as 3" should be still "red die came up as a 3", which means $P(A \cap R) = P(R)$. For (a), $P(A|R) = P(A \cap R)/P(R) = P(R)/P(R) = 1$. For (b), $P(R|A) = P(A \cap R)/P(A) = P(R)/P(A) \neq P(R)$. For (d), $P(A) = 11/36$ since there are 11 valid combinations out of 36(the size of sample space).
\end{solution}



\probheadernum{4}

Which of the following sets are well ordered under the standard `$<$` ordering?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\mathbb{N}$
\item $\mathbb{Z}$
\item $\mathbb{Z}^+$
\item $\mathbb{R}^+ \cup \{0\}$ 
\item $\{0, 1 , 2\}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
A, C, E
\\
A set is well-ordered when every subset of that set has a least element under the given ordering. This is true for $\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z^+}$, and ${0,1,2}$ under the standard `$<$` ordering. For (c), the set of all integers, $Z$ has no least element under $<$. While the set $\mathbb{R}^+ \cup \{0\}$ has a least element (0), it is not true that every subset of this set has a least element (for example, $\mathbb{R^+}$).

\textbf{Suppose we have a bag with three balls numbered 1, 2, and 3. Alice draws a ball from the bag (and does not put it back), and then Bob draws a ball from the bag. Let $X$ be the value of the ball Alice drew, $Y$ be the value of the ball Bob drew.}

Which of the following are true?
\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item $E(X) = 2$
    \item $E(Y) = 2$
    \item $E(XY) = 4$
    \item $E(X+Y) = 4$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
A, B, D
\\
(c) is not guaranteed since $X$ and $Y$ are not independent, and if you solve for it you get $\frac{11}{3}$

Now, there is a second bag with five balls numbered 1 through 5. Carol draws a ball from this second bag. Let $Z$ be the value of the ball Carol drew, and again let $X$ and $Y$ be values of the balls that Alice and Bob drew, respectively. Which of the following are true? 
\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item $V(X) = \frac{2}{3}$
    \item $V(X+Y) = V(X)+V(Y)$
    \item $V(Z) = 2$
    \item $V(X+Z) = V(X)+V(Z)$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
A, C, D
\\
(B) is not guaranteed since $X$ and $Y$ are not independent. (D) works because $X$ and $Z$ are independent.
