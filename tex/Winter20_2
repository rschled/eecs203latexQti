% Team 1, Question 2
Consider license plates with 7 characters, each of which can either be an uppercase letter or a numerical digit 0 through 9.  How many possible license plates are there that start or end with the word ``CAT"?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $26^4+26^4-26$
    \item $36^4$
    \item $26^4+26^4+10$
    \item $36^4+36^4-36$
    \item $36^4+36^4$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(d) \\
Since there are 26 uppercase letters and 10 digits, each character on the license plate has 36 options.  There are $36^4$ license plate that start with CAT and $36^4$ license plates that end with CAT.  There are 36 license plates that both start and end with CAT.  Therefore, by the inclusion exclusion principle, there are $36^4+36^4-36$ license plates that start or end with CAT.
\end{solution}

% Team 2, Question 5
\textit{Reminders:} A standard deck has 52 cards with 4 suits ($\heartsuit, \diamondsuit, \clubsuit, \spadesuit$) and 13 ranks (2, 3, \dots, 10, Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K), Ace (A)). \\

Joseph randomly draws a hand of $13$ cards from a standard deck of cards. What is the probability of his hand contains exactly two Aces?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\frac{4\cdot3\cdot\binom{48}{11}}{\binom{52}{13}}$
\item $\frac{\binom{4}{2}\cdot\binom{48}{11}}{\binom{52}{13}}$
\item $\left(\frac{4}{52}\right)^2\cdot\left(\frac{48}{52}\right)^{11}$
\item $\left(\frac{4}{52}\right)^2\cdot\left(\frac{48}{52}\right)^{11}\cdot(13)!$
\item $\left(\frac{4}{52}\right)^2\cdot\left(\frac{48}{52}\right)^{11}\cdot\binom{13}{2}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(b)\\
The size of the sample space is the number of ways to choose $13$ cards out of $52$ cards, which is $\binom{52}{13}$. The task of drawing $13$ cards with exactly two Aces can be viewed as the cascade of drawing $2$ Aces out of $4$ Aces and drawing $11$ non-Aces out of $48$ non-Aces. By the product rule, the size of the event is $\binom{4}{2}\cdot\binom{48}{11}$. Since we assume random drawing, all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely, the probability is $\frac{\binom{4}{2}\cdot\binom{48}{11}}{\binom{52}{13}}$.
\end{solution}

\probheadernum{4}\\
% Team 3, Question 1
Brian dealt out a standard 52-card deck of cards. What is the probability that the first King occurs on the 20th card?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\frac{\binom{52}{19}\cdot\binom{4}{1}\cdot42!}{52!}$
\item $\frac{(48!/29!)\cdot32!\cdot4}{52!}$
\item $\frac{51!\cdot4}{52!}$
\item $\frac{(48!/29!)\cdot4}{52!}$
\item $(\frac{48}{52})^{19}\cdot\frac{4}{52}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(b)\\
The sample space is all the possible permutations of 52 cards. The event is the set of permutations that the first king occurs at the 20th position. The first 19 positions must not have rank of king, and hence $\frac{48!}{29!}$ ways to form the first 19 positions. 4 options at the 20th position because each rank can take on 4 possible suits. The arrangement of the rest of 32 cards has no constraint, and there are 32! ways to form the remaining 32 positions.
\end{solution}

% Emily Graetz, Seinfeldish Question
Pam wants to prank her mom for April Fools' Day.  When she pulls a prank on her mom, her mom will react in one of 3 different ways: she laughs, she groans, or she gets angry.  Each of these 3 reactions are equally likely.  Pam will keep pranking her mom until she gets at least one laugh and at least one groan.  How many pranks should Pam expect to have to pull?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 1.5
    \item 3
    \item 4.5
    \item 5.5
    \item 6
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(c)\\
Let $X$ be the number of pranks needed to pull to get both reactions.  We will let $X_1$ be the number of pranks until you get your first of laugh or groan, and $X_2$ be the number of pranks after your first laugh or groan until you get the other.  $X=X_1+X_2$, so $E(X)=E(X_1+X_2)=E(X_1)+E(X_2)$.  Both $X_1$ and $X_2$ are geometric random variables.  $X_1$ has success probability $2/3$, while $X_2$ has success probability $1/3$, so $E(X)=E(X_1)+E(X_2)=\frac1{2/3}+\frac1{1/3}=\frac32+3=4.5$
\end{solution}

% Team 4, Question 2
24 IAs sit in a circle for board game night. Grace wants to sit next to Yunsoo and directly across from Eric. 

If they sit down randomly, what is the probability that this happens?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $\frac{21!}{24!}$
    \item $\frac{24 \cdot 21!}{24!}$ 
    \item $\frac{24 \cdot 2 \cdot 21!}{24!}$ 
    \item $\frac{2 \cdot 21!}{24!}$ 
    \item $\frac{24 \cdot 2}{24!}$ 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(c)\\
Sample space: there are 24! possible ways that the 24 IAs can sit.
\\Event: Grace can sit in 24 spots. Yunsoo, sitting right next to her, can sit in two possible spots (to her left or to her right). Eric can only sit in one possible spot. Hence, there are $24 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 21!$ ways that both events can occur.
\\Dividing the event by the sample space gives us the probability of the event: $\frac{24 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 21!}{24!}$
\end{solution}

% Greg, Binomial Coefficient Question
In the binomial expansion of $(1/x^2 + x)^{15}$, what is the coefficient of the term $x^7$?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 0
    \item $15 \choose 7$
    \item $15 \choose 5$
    \item $15 \choose 9$
    \item 1
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(a)\\
Expand the expression
\begin{align*}
(x^{-2} + x)^{15}  =& \sum_{k=0}^{15} {15\choose k}{(x^{-2})}^k {x}^{15-k} \\
=& \sum_{k=0}^{15} {15\choose k}x^{-2k} x^{15-k} \\
=& \sum_{k=0}^{15} {15\choose k}x^{-2k+15-k} \\
=& \sum_{k=0}^{15} {15\choose k}x^{15-3k}\\
\end{align*}
Since the non-zero terms in the expansion have exponents that are multiples of 3, the coefficient for $x^7$ is 0. 
\end{solution}

% Team 2, Question 2
Michigan's basketball team is predicted to win 60\% of the games they play. When the team is predicted to win, they have a 70\% probability of actual winning. When they are predicted to lose, they have a 45\% probability of winning. Given that Michigan won a basketball game, what is the probability that they were predicted to win?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 0.6
\item $0.6\cdot0.7$
\item $\frac{0.7}{0.45+0.7}$
\item $\frac{0.6\cdot0.7}{0.6\cdot0.7+0.6\cdot(1-0.45)}$
\item $\frac{0.6\cdot0.7}{0.6\cdot0.7+(1-0.6)\cdot0.45}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(e)\\
Denote $W_p$ and $L_p$ as the events of predicted winning and losing, $W$ and $L$ as the events of actual winning and losing. Then
\[
P(W_p|W)=\frac{P(W_p)\cdot P(W|W_p)}{P(W_p)\cdot P(W|W_p)+P(L_p)\cdot P(W|L_p)}=\frac{0.6\cdot 0.7}{0.6\cdot0.7+(1-0.6)\cdot0.45}
\]
\end{solution}

% Team 4, Question 1

You would like to cross the river depicted below.  Sometimes, though, the bridges are broken.  Each bridge has probability $p$ that you can \textbf{cross it}.  What is the probability that you are able to get across the river.

\includegraphics[]{question9.png}




\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $4p^2$
\item $2p^2 + 2p^3$
\item $4p-6p^2+6p^3-p^4$
\item $(2p-p^2)^2$
\item $(2p^2 - 3p)^2$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(d)\\
We need cross one of the bridges on the left to get to the island, then cross one of the bridges on the right to get to the other shore.  The probability that we can get to the island is $p + p - p^2$ (because of inclusion-exclusion). The probability that you can get from the island to the right shore is also $2p - p^2$. So the probability that you can cross the river is $(2p-p^2)^2$
\end{solution}

\probheadernum{4}\\
% Team 2, Question 3
How many 52 letter non-decreasing strings are there when the letters are chosen with repetition from the 26-letter English alphabet (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)?\\
(Note: Non-decreasing means that a letter at a latter position can only be the same or greater than its former letter, so a string of ``aabxzzzz" would be valid, whereas ``a\textbf{\underline{db}}" would not be valid.)\\
\textit{Hint:} Consider how you can use stars and bars to solve this.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\binom{52}{26}$
\item $\binom{77}{51}$
\item $26^{52}$
\item $\binom{77}{25}$
\item $\binom{78}{51}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(d)\\
This boils down to a Stars and Bars problem. We just need to choose the letters of the string, since once we have letters there is exactly one way to make a valid string (arrange the letters in a non-decreasing order). We have 25 bars coming from the 26 possible letter choices. Each letter in the string is a star that fits into one of the letter boxes. We have $\binom{\text{stars+bars}}{\text{stars}}=\binom{25+52}{25}=\binom{77}{25}$ possible strings.
\end{solution}

\probheadernum{4}\\
% Team 3, Question 5

Balls labeled 1 through 9 are placed in a knapsack. Two balls are selected from the knapsack, one at a time without replacement. The first ball we draw is even.  What is the probability that the second ball is greater than the first ball?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 1/9
\item 3/8
\item 4/9
\item 1/2
\item 5/8
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(d)

We can solve this with the law of total probability.  Let $X=$the value of the first ball and $Y=$the value of the second ball.  $P(Y>X|X\text{ is even})=P(Y>X|X=2)P(X=2|X\text{ is even})+P(Y>X|X=4)P(X=4|X\text{ is even})+P(Y>X|X=6)P(X=6|X\text{ is even})+P(Y>X|X=8)P(X=8|X\text{ is even})$. 
Plugging in values, we get $\frac78\cdot\frac14+\frac58\cdot\frac14+\frac38\cdot\frac14+\frac18\cdot\frac14$.  Factoring out the $\frac14$, we have $\frac14(\frac78+\frac58+\frac38+\frac18)=\frac14(2)=\frac12$

% Team 4, Question 11
Emily pays \$1 to play a dice game.  She rolls a fair 6-sided die.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If she rolls a 1 or a 2 she loses another \$2
    \item If she rolls a 3 or 4 she wins \$4
    \item If she rolls a 5 or a 6 she wins \$7
\end{itemize}
Let X be a random variable for the amount of money Emily gained or lost due to playing the game. (\textbf{Remember} that she spent \$1 to play the game.) \\

What is $E(X)$? What is $Var(X)$?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $E(X) = 2$
    \item $E(X) = 3$
    \item $E(X) = \frac{13}{3}$
    \item $Var(X) = 14$
    \item $Var(X) = \frac{38}{9}$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution} (a) (d)
Since Emily pays \$1 to play, Emily can lose \$3, win \$3, or win \$6.
$$E(X) = -3(1/3) + 3(1/3) + (6)(1/3)$$
$$E(X) = 2$$ \\

$$E(X^2) = 9(1/3) + 9(1/3) + 36(1/3)$$
$$E(X^2) = 3 + 3 + 12 = 18$$

$$Var(X) = 18 - 2^2 = 14$$

    \item Yes. $\mathbb{Z} \cap \mathbb{Q^-}$ is equivalent to ${Z^-}$. The negative integers is well-ordered under $>$.
    \item No. The subset $(-2, 7)$ does not have a least element.
    \item No. The set $\mathbb{N}$ does not have a least element under $>$.
    \item Yes. Notice that this is the set $\{-\frac{1}{1}, -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{3}, ...\} \cup \{0, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4} ...\}$. Under $<$, a subset of one of the component sets will always have a least (the smallest $n$ produces it), and a subset with some from each will have a least that is the least in the first set, as everything in the first set is less than everything in the second.
