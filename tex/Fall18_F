\probheadernum{4}

An undirected graph $G$ has 10 edges and an unknown number of vertices. Two of the vertices have degree 3, and another two vertices have degree 4. All remaining vertices have degree less than $3$. Which of the following statements regarding the total number of vertices in $G$ is the most accurate? 

\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item There must be fewer than 10 vertices in $G$.
     \item There must be fewer than 12 vertices in $G$.
     \item There must be at least 7 vertices in $G$.
     \item There must be at least 10 vertices in $G$.
    \item None of the above.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
(c)

Assuming there are $m$ vertices. Based on the handshake theorem, $2\times 10 \leq 2\times 3 + 2\times 4 + (m-4)\times 2$. Thus $m\ge 7$.
\end{solution}

\vspace{2cm}

\probheadernum{4}

If graph $A = K_8$, graph $B = K_{10}$, and graphs $A$ and $B$ share exactly 5 vertices, then how many edges are in $A \cup B$?

\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item 26
    \item 36
    \item 63
    \item 68
    \item 73
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
(c)

Using the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion, we are able to compute the number of edges in the union of the two graphs:

$|E_{A \cup B}| = |E_A| + |E_B| - |E_{A \cap B}|$

Since each of graphs A, B, and $A \cap B$ are complete graphs, then the number of edges in each individual graph on the RHS is equal to the number of vertices choose 2, or in other words, $\frac{v \cdot (v - 1)}{2}$ where v equals the number of vertices in each graph. Therefore, $|E_{A \cup B}| = \frac{8 \cdot 7}{2} + \frac{10 \cdot 9}{2} - \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 28 + 45 - 10 = 63$
\end{solution}

Find the number of the non-negative integer solutions to the equation 
$$a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 47$$

\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item $\binom{53}{6}$
    \item $\binom{54}{7}$
    \item $\frac{47!}{40!}$
    \item $\binom{47}{7}$
    \item $47!$
\end{enumerate}


\begin{solution}
(a)

This is a Stars 'n Bars. We have 7 variables, so 6 bars, and 47 stars, thus resulting in answer choice (a). 
\end{solution}

\probheadernum{4}

What is the value of $4^{35}$ mod 17?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 1
\item 5
\item 9
\item 13
\item 16
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution} (d) \\
Method 1: Fermat's Little Theorem ($a^p \equiv a ($mod$ p)$, where p is prime): \\
$4^{35} \equiv (4^{17})^2 \cdot 4 \equiv ($by Fermat's Little Theorem$) (4)^2 \cdot 4 \equiv 64 \equiv 13$ (mod 17) \\
Method 2: $4^2 \equiv 16 \equiv$ -1 (mod 17)\\
$4^{32} \equiv (4^2)^{16} \equiv (-1)^{16} = 1$ (mod 17) \\
$4^3 \equiv 4^2 \cdot 4 \equiv -1 \cdot 4$ = -4 (mod 17) \\
$4^{35} \equiv 4^{32} \cdot 4^{3} \equiv 1(-4) \equiv -4 \equiv 13$ (mod 17)
\end{solution}

\probheadernum{4}

We are given the following roots for an unknown recurrence relation: $-1$ and $-1$ (\textit{this is not a typo}). The initial conditions for our recurrence relation are $a_{0} = 2, a_{1} = 5$. What is $a_{2}$? 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item -12
\item -5
\item 5
\item 7
\item There is not enough information to solve this problem.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
(a)\\
Based on our roots, we can represent our recurrence relation as follows:\\
$a_{n} = c_1 (-1)^n + c_2 n (-1)^n = (c_1 + nc_2)(-1)^{n}$\\ \\
We can then use our initial conditions to find the two constants: \\
$a_{0} = c_1 = 2$ \\
$a_{1} = -(c_1 + c_2) = 5$, so $c_2 = -7$\\

\noindent Our final relation, then, is: \\
$a_{n} = (2 - 7n)(-1)^{n}$\\
$a_{2} = (2 - 7 \cdot 2)(-1)^{2} = -12$.
\end{solution}

How many positive integers less than 200 are congruent to 2 mod 4, including 2?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 49
\item 50
\item 51
\item 100
\item 101
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(b)

All numbers congruent to 2 mod 4 are of the form $4k+2$. The largest positive integer less than 200 that has a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 is 198, thus we have an arithmetic sequence 2, 6, 10, ...., 194, 198 which has 50 elements.
\end{solution}

Find the roots of the characteristic equation corresponding to the following recurrence relation: $$a_{n} = 6a_{n-2} - 8a_{n-4}$$
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 2, 2, -2, -2
\item $\sqrt{2}$, -$\sqrt{2}$
\item $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{2}$, -$\sqrt{2}$, -$\sqrt{2}$
\item 2, -2, $\sqrt{2}$, -$\sqrt{2}$
\item 2, -2
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
(d)

We first create our characteristic equation:\\
$r^{4} = 6r^{2} - 8$\\ \\
Next, we must find the roots: \\
$r^{4} - 6r^{2} + 8 = 0$\\
$(r^{2} - 2)(r^{2} - 4) = 0$\\
$r = 2, -2, \sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}$

Which of the following posets have a greatest element?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 
    $(S, |)$, where $S = \{2, 3, 5, 10\}$.
    \item 
    $(S, |)$, where $S = \{2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 20, 60 \}$.
    \item 
    $(S, \leq)$, where $S = \{x \in \Q: 0 \leq x^2 \leq 3\}$.
    \item 
    $(\mathcal{P}(\R), \subseteq)$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
(b), (d).

(a) has two maximal elements (3,10) and thus has no greatest element.

(b) has only one maximal element, so it has a greatest element.

(c) has no maximal element as $\sqrt{3}$ is not a rational number, so it does not have a greatest element.

(d) has one maximal element which is $\R$, so it has a greatest element.

\end{solution}

Which of the following graphs are bipartite? Select all that apply.

\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item $C_6$
    \item $Q_3$
    \item $W_6$
    \item $K_5$
    \item $C_{31}$
\end{enumerate}


\begin{solution}
(a), (b) 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 
    $C_6$ is bipartite since we are able to alternate colors around the cycle and there will never be a case where two of the same color are adjacent.
    \item
    $Q_3$ is bipartite since we can divide the vertices into these two classes: those bit strings with an odd number of 1's, and those bit strings with an even number of 1's.
    \item 
    $W_6$ is both not bipartite since there are triangles within the graph which can never be 2-colorable.
    \item
    Similarly for $K_5$, there are triangles within the graph which cannot be 2-colorable.
    \item
    $C_{31}$ is not bipartite since any cycle with an odd number of vertices would always have to have two vertices that are adjacent with the same coloring. This property is much more easily observed on cycles with less vertices, such as $C_3$ or $C_5$.
\end{enumerate}
  

\end{solution}

Consider the relation $R$ on the set of integers greater than or equal to 2, such that $a$ relates to $b$ if $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime. For instance, 7 relates to 8. What properties hold for $R$?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $R$ is reflexive
\item $R$ is irreflexive
\item $R$ is symmetric
\item $R$ is antisymmetric
\item $R$ is transitive
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}

(b), (c)
\begin{itemize}
\item If $a$ is relatively prime to $b$, then $b$ must also be relatively prime to $a$, so $R$ is symmetric. 
\item $R$ is not reflexive since 5 is not relatively prime with 5 (5 and 5 are both divisible by 5). 
\item $R$ is not transitive since (2, 3) $\in$ $R$ and (3, 8) $\in$ $R$ but (2, 8) $\notin$ $R$ since 2 and 8 are both divisible by 2. 
%\item $R$ is not asymmetric because (2, 3) $\in$ $R$ and (3, 2) $\in$ $R$. 
\item $R$ is not antisymmetric because, again, (2, 3) $\in$ $R$ and (3, 2) $\in$ $R$ and $2 \neq 3$.

\item R is irreflexive because $a$ cannot be relatively prime to itself.
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}

Which of the following are true given the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f(x) = x - \sqrt{x}$
    \item $g(x) = \log(x^{2})$
    \item $h(x) = \log(x) + \sqrt{x}$
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $f(x)$ is O$(g(x))$
    \item $f(x)$ is $\Omega(h(x))$
    \item $f(x)$ is $\Theta(h(x))$
    \item $g(x)$ is O$(h(x))$
    \item $h(x)$ is O$(g(x))$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(b), (d)\\
$f(x)$ is $\Theta(x)$ because $x$ dominates the $\sqrt{x}$ term. \\
$g(x)$ is $\Theta(\log(x))$ because $\log(x^{2})$ = $2\log(x)$. \\
$h(x)$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{x})$ because $\sqrt{x}$ grows faster than $\log(x)$. Thus, only B and D hold.
\end{solution}

A sample space can be partitioned into three events, $E_1$, $E_2,$ and $E_3$, and it can also be partitioned into two different events, $G_1$ and $G_2$. We are given that $P(E_1) = P(G_1) = \frac{2}{5}$. Which of the following must be true? 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $P(E_1 | G_1) = P(G_1 | E_1)$
\item $P(E_1) = \frac{2}{5}P(E_1 | G_1) + \frac{3}{5}P(E_1 | G_2)$
\item $P(E_1 | G_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \cap G_2)}{P(E_1)}$
\item $P(E_1) = \frac{2}{3} P(G_2)$
%\item $P(E_1) = 1 - P((E_2 \cup E_3) \cap G_1)) - P((E_2 \cup E_3) \cap G_2))$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(a), (b), (d)

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item True. $P(E_1 | G_1)P(G_1) = P(G_1 | E_1)P(E_1)$ for any events $E_1$ and $G_1$, and we know that $P(E_1) = P(G_1)$
\item True. $P(E_1) = P(G_1)P(E_1 | G_1) + P(G_2)P(E_1 | G_2) = \frac{2}{5}P(E_1 | G_1) + \frac{3}{5}P(E_1 | G_2)$
\item False. The correct relationship would be that $P(E_1 | G_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \cap G_2)}{P(G_2)}$
\item True. $(G_2) = 1 - P(G_1) = 0.6$, so $P(E_1) = 0.4 = (2/3)(0.6)$

%\item True. $P(E_1) = 1 - P((E_2 \cup E_3) \cap G_1)) - P((E_2 \cup E_3) \cap G_2)) =  1 - P(E_2 \cup E_3) = 1 - P(E_2) - P(E_3)$

Given sets $A$, $B$, and $C$ such that $|A| = 3, |B| = 6$, and $|C| = 8$, which of the following \textbf{could be true}? Select all that apply.


\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
    \item $|A \cap C| = 8$
    \item $|(C - B) \times A| = 9$
    \item $B$ is the power set of $A$
    \item $C$ is the power set of $A$
    \item $\left( (A \times B) \cap C \neq \varnothing \right) \wedge \left( A \cap C \neq \varnothing \right)$
\end{enumerate}


\begin{solution}
(b), (d), (e)

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $A \cap C = 8$ cannot be true since the maximum number of terms in the intersection of two sets is equal to the minimum cardinality of the two sets which in this case is 3.
    \item
    Secondly, if $|(C - B) \times A| = 9$ is true, then $|(C - B)| = 3$ since $|A| = 3$. This can be true if 5 of the 6 elements of set B are included in set C meaning that $|(C - B)| = 8 - 5 = 3$. This means that answer (b) can be correct.
    \item
    $B = P(A)$ is not possible since $6 \neq 2^3$.
    \item
    $C = P(A)$ could be true since the number of terms in a power set of a set is $2^n$ and $8 = 2^3$ therefore it is possible. So answer (d) could be correct.
    \item
    When considering $(A \times B)  \cap C  \neq \varnothing \wedge A \cap C \neq \varnothing$, let us consider the following: $\{1, (1,2)\} \subset A, \{2\} \subset b$, and $\{(1,2)\} \subset C$. This would mean that $\{(1,2)\} \subset (A \times B)$ and therefore that $\{(1,2)\} \subset (A \times B) \cap C$. Now considering the second part of the statement, $\{(1,2)\} \subset A$ meaning that $\{(1,2)\} \subset A \cap C$. With these two examples together, we have shown that answer (e) can be correct.
\end{enumerate}
    

\end{solution}
