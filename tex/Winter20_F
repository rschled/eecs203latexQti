% Team 1, Question 3
How many relations on a set $S$ are transitive, given that $|S|=2$?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 2
\item 4
\item 9
\item 13
\item 16
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(d)\\
Suppose $S=\{a,b\}$. The only way that a relation $R$ on $S$ is \textit{not} transitive is if $(a,b),(b,a)\in R$, but at least one of $(a,a)$ and $(b,b)$ is not in $R$. There are only 3 relations that are not transitive, namely $\{(a,b),(b,a)\}$, $\{(a,b),(b,a),(a,a)\}$, and $\{(a,b),(b,a),(b,b)\}$. There are $2^2$ potential ordered pairs, so there are $2^{2^2}-3=13$ relations that are transitive.
\end{solution}

% Team 1, Question 5
Stewart, Emily, Grace, and Katie are the only people running for EECS Mayor. There are 150 people voting, and each voter votes completely at random for exactly one person. What is the probability that at least one of them receives 30 or more votes?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $0$
\item $\frac{1}{30}$
\item $\frac{1}{5}$
\item $\frac{3}{5}$
\item $1$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(e)\\
Since each person can only vote for one of the four contenders, we can consider this as putting 150 objects into 4 boxes. By the generalized pigeonhole principle, we know that at least one box has at least $\lceil \frac{150}{4} \rceil$, or 38, objects. This means that we know at least one of the contenders receives at least 30 votes, so the probability is 1.
\end{solution}


\probheadernum{4}\\
% Team 2, Question 1
% TODO: Reword!
Consider the sequence defined by the recurrence relation $a_n$, and unspecified base cases. Which is the tightest big O bound can we guarantee?

\[
    a_{n}=5a_{n-1}-6a_{n-2}
\]
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $n^2$
\item $n^3$
\item $2^n$
\item $3^n$
\item $n!$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(d)\\
This can be found by solving the characteristic equation, which works out to be $r^2-5r+6=0$. This yields roots $r=2$ and $r=3$. Thus, $a_{n}=c_{1}(2)^n+c_{2}(3)^n$, which is $O(3^{n})$.
\end{solution}


\probheadernum{4}\\
% Team 2, Question 4, Alternate
The Hamming distance $H(s_1,s_2)$ between two bit strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $H(\underline{0}0\underline{1},\underline{1}0\underline{0})=2$
    \item $H(1\underline{1}01,1\underline{0}01)=1$. 
\end{itemize}
Consider randomly selecting two bit strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ from the set of all bit strings of length $5$ \emph{with repetition} (i.e. it is allowed that the two strings are equal). Find $E(H(s_1,s_2))$, the expected value of the Hamming distance between $s_1$ and $s_2$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\frac{5}{4}$
\item $\frac{5}{2}$
\item $\frac{C(5,1)+2\cdot C(5,2)+3\cdot C(5,3)+4\cdot C(5,4)+5\cdot C(5,5)}{2^5-1}$
\item $\frac{15}{4}$
\item $5$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(b)\\
Denote $s_{ij}$ to be the $j$-th bit of string $s_i$. Then for all $j$,
\[
E(H(s_{1j},s_{2j}))=\frac{1}{2}\cdot0+\frac{1}{2}\cdot1=\frac{1}{2},
\]
and
\[
E(H(s_1,s_2))=\sum_{j=1}^5E(H(s_{1j},s_{2j}))=\frac{5}{2}.
\]
\end{solution}

% Team 3, Question 1

Brian is shopping for ice cream, and the grocery store has 6 pints left, each of a different flavor. He doesn't want to come back empty-handed, so he buys at least one pint. In how many ways can he buy his ice cream?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $2^6-1$
\item $2^6$
\item $\binom{7}{6}-1$
\item $\binom{7}{6}$
\item $6$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(a)\\
There are $2$ options for each flavor of ice cream (in/out) and there are $6$ flavors of ice cream. However, we are overcounting the scenario of all $6$ flavors being out since Brian has to buy at least $1$ pint of ice cream, so we subtract $1$.
\end{solution}

Brian is pulling cards out of a standard deck of cards one at a time, without replacement, until all cards have been pulled out. How many different ways are there for Brian to pull cards if for every rank (number/face) all four suits of that rank get pulled one after another consecutively?

For example, he could start with $(5\heartsuit,5\spadesuit,5\clubsuit,5\diamondsuit,\ \ 2\spadesuit,2\diamondsuit,2\clubsuit,2\heartsuit,...)$,\\
while $(2\heartsuit,3\spadesuit,3\clubsuit,3\heartsuit,3\diamondsuit,4\clubsuit,...)$ is an invalid sequence.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $13!$
\item $\frac{13!}{4!}$
\item $13!\cdot 4!$
\item $13!\cdot(4!\cdot13)$
\item $13!\cdot(4!)^{13}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(e)\\

Consider first the ordering between the ranks. There are 13 ranks, so this means that there are $13!$ different ways to order the ranks to get pulled out.

Next, we consider the arrangement within each rank. We have to order the $4$ cards of that rank.  For each of the $13$ ranks, there are $4!$ ways to order the cards of all the four suits. Since we have to order the $4$ cards in all of the $13$ ranks, $4!$ is multiplied $13$ times, or $(4!)^{13}$.

So the total is $13! \cdot (4!)^{13}$
\end{solution}


\probheadernum{4}\\
% Team 3, Question 4
Hao rolls 2 fair dice, and he decides to use random variable $X$ to denote the quotient of the first die divided by the second die. What can we say about $X$?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $X$ is a not a function
\item $X$ is one-to-one but not onto
\item $X$ is onto but not one-to-one
\item $X$ is one-to-one and onto
\item $X$ is neither one-to-one nor onto
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(e)\\
A random variable is a function from the sample space to $\mathbb{R}$. $X$ is not onto because not every real number is mapped to, e.g. 43 is not mapped to. $X$ is not one-to-one because, for example, $3$ can be mapped to from both $(3,1)$ and $(6,2)$. 
\end{solution}


\probheadernum{4}\\
% Team 4, Question 2
$R$ is an irreflexive relation on a set $A$.  If we add the in-degree and out-degree of every vertex in the graph of $R$, we get a total of $30$. What is the minimum value $|A|$ could be?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 4
\item 5
\item 6
\item 8
\item 11
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(b)\\
The Handshaking Theorem tells us that each (directed) edge will be counted twice in the sum, once for the in-degree and once for the out-degree; hence, there are total $30/2=15$ edges. Since $R$ is irreflexive, there is no self-loop. So if $|A|=n$, then there is at most $n(n-1)$ edges, since every vertex can be directed to all the other $n-1$ vertices. When $n=4$, $4\cdot(4-1)=12<15$, which is not possible, while when $n=5$, $5\cdot(5-1)=20>15$, which is possible.
\end{solution}


\probheadernum{4}\\
% Team 4, Question 4
Jose likes to two-color graphs using red and blue stickers, which he sticks on each vertex. Jose will be given a bipartite graph with 8 vertices to two-color, but he doesn't know what the graph will be. What is the minimum number of stickers he needs to prepare in advance, so that he can guarantee he will be able to two-color this graph?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 8
    \item 9
    \item 11
    \item 12
    \item 14
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution} (c)
There are 4 possibilities for the grouping of 8 vertices into two parts. 
(7, 1), (6, 2), (5, 3), (4, 4). To account for the worst case in all 4 scenarios, we need 7 red + 4 blue (or vice-versa) = 11 stickers in total. Note that if we had (8, 0), that would require that there are no edges in the graph, so we can pick a different 2-coloring with whatever stickers we want.
\end{solution}

The recurrence is $T(n)=2T(n/3)+O(n^2)$. Since $\frac{2}{3^2}<1$, by the Master Theorem this algorithm is $\Theta(n^2)$.

% Team 1, Question 6
\begin{comment}
% Original $|S|=5$ version
Let $R$ be an equivalence relation over the set $S$, where $|S|=5$. Which of the following are possible values for $|R|$?
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 5
\item 7
\item 9
\item 11
\item 13
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)\\
We know $R$ is an equivalence relation, thus it can be partitioned into equivalence classes with the following number of elements in each class: $11111$, $2111$, $221$, $311$, $32$, $41$, $5$. From this we know that all elements within a class must relate to each other, thus within each class we have $n^2$ relations. From this, the possible number of related pairs can then be
\begin{align*}
1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 &= 5\\
2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 &= 7\\
2^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 &= 9\\
3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 &= 11\\
3^2 + 2^2 &= 13 \\
4^2 + 1^2 &= 17 \\
5^2 &= 25
\end{align*}
From this, we can see all the answer choices are plausible.

% Team 4, Question 8
Which of the following statements are true:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $(n^4+3^n)(\log(n)+\sqrt{n})$ is $O(n^4\sqrt{n})$
\item $(n!+10^n)(n^2+2^n)$ is $O(10^nn^2)$
\item $\frac{3n^5+n^3+1}{n^5+1}$ is $O(1)$
\item $(n!+10n)(n^3+n^2)$ is $O(10n^4)$
\item $(e^n+\log(n))(10^n+2^n)$ is $O(10^{2n})$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(c)(e) 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $(n^4+3^n) \in O(3^n)$ and $(\log(n)+\sqrt{n}) \in O(\sqrt n)$ \\ So $(n^4+3^n)(\log(n)+\sqrt{n})$ is $O(3^n\sqrt n)$
\item $(n!+10^n) \in O(n!)$ and $(n^2+2^n) \in O(2^n)$ \\ So $(n!+10^n)(n^2+2^n)$ is $O(n!2^n)$
\item $\frac{3n^5+n^3+1}{n^5+1} \leq \frac{5n^5}{n^5+1} \leq \frac{5n^5}{n^5} = 5$ which is $O(1)$
\item $(n!+10n) \in O(n!)$ and $(n^3+n^2) \in O(n^3)$ \\ So $(n!+10n)(n^3+n^2)$ is $O(n!n^3)$
\item $(e^n+\log(n)) \in O(e^n)$ and $(10^n+2^n) \in O(10^n)$ \\ So $(e^n+\log(n))(10^n+2^n)$ is $O(e^n10^n)$ which is $O(10^n10^n)$ and that equals $O(10^{2n})$

% Additional, Question 1
Suppose we want to find a solution to the following system of linear congruences:
\begin{center}
$x \equiv 2 \mod{7}$\\
$x \equiv 6 \mod{10}$\\
$x \equiv 11 \mod{13}$\\
\end{center}
Which of the following terms must be computed when solving for $x$ using the Chinese Remainder Theorem
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $(6 \cdot 11)^{-1} \mod{7}$
\item $(7 \cdot 6 \cdot 13)^{-1} \mod{10}$
\item $(7 \cdot 10)^{-1} \mod{13}$
\item $2 \cdot 6 \cdot 11$
\item $7 \cdot 10 \cdot 13$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(c)(e)\\
Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can compute $x$ as:\\
\scalebox{0.7}{
$x \equiv \left(2 \cdot (10 \cdot 13) \cdot [(10 \cdot 13)^{-1} \mod{7}] + 6 \cdot (7 \cdot 13) \cdot [(7 \cdot 13)^{-1} \mod{10}] + 11 \cdot (7 \cdot 10) \cdot [(7 \cdot 10)^{-1} \mod{13}] \right) \mod{7 \cdot 10 \cdot 13}$.
}\\
We need to calculate the inverses of the products of two moduli mod the other modulus (c), as well as the product of all the moduli (e).

% Additional, Question 4
Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be three distinct prime numbers such that $A=2B+1$. Which of the following are correct?  

\textit{Note:} Make sure to read each modulus, as they are not all the same.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $C^{AB}\equiv C^B\pmod{A}$
\item $C^{AB}\equiv C^3\pmod{B}$
\item $B^{-1}\equiv -2\pmod{A}$
\item $A^{-1}\equiv 1\pmod{B}$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{solution}
(a)(b)(c)(d)
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Since $A$ is prime and $C$ is not divisible by $A$, we have $C^{A}\equiv C\pmod{A}$ by Fermat’s Little Theorem. Then $C^{AB}=(C^{A})^B\equiv (C)^B\pmod{A}$.
\item Similarly, we know that $C^{B}\equiv C\pmod{B}$ and $C^{AB}\equiv C^A\pmod{B}$, which can be turned into $C^A=C^{2B+1}=(C^B)^2\cdot C =(C)^2\cdot C\equiv C^3\pmod{B}$.
\item It is sufficient to verify whether $B(-2)\equiv1\pmod{A}$. Indeed, $B(-2)=-2B\equiv A-2B=(2B+1)-2B\equiv1\pmod{A}$.
\item Since $A=2B+1$, we get that $A\equiv 1\pmod{B}$. Then $A^{-1}\equiv1^{-1}\equiv1\pmod{B}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
