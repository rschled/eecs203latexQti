How many numbers must be selected from the set of all integers to guarantee that at least 2 of the numbers are divisible by 100?


    
  * 100
    
  * 101
    
  * 201
    
  * 10,001
    
  * This cannot be guaranteed 



    (e) It is possible to keep selecting integers and have none of them be divisible by 100. Note that we cannot apply the Pigeon-hole Principle here. If the question was asking about numbers that have the same remainder when divided by 100, then we could use the PP to determine we need 101 integers to guarantee this. Remember that the PP guarantees that at least one hole has at least two pigeons, but can never guarantee the number of pigeons in a particular hole.

A river splits up into two branches, then recombines after a series of dams in each branch. As shown in the figure below, Branch A has two dams and Branch B has three dams.  At any particular time, each dam has a probability of 0.1 of being lowered, and each dam is lowered independently of the others. Water can flow through only if at least one branch has all of its dams lowered. What is the probability that water can flow through?

    < g r a p h i c s >



    
  * 1 - 0.9^5
    
  * 0.1^3 + 0.1^2 - 0.1^5
    
  * 0.1^3 + 0.1^2
    
  * 0.1^5
    
  * 1 - (0.9^3 + 0.9^2)


(b) 

Water can flow through if all the dams in branch A are lowered or all the dams in branch B are lowered. We now use inclusion-exclusion principle. The probability of any individual gate being lowered is 0.1 and each gate is independent of the other gates, so we use product rule to find the following probabilities. The probability that the water can flow through branch A is 0.1^2 and the probability that the water can flow through branch B is 0.1^3.  The probability that water can flow through both branch A and B is 0.1^2 · 0.1^3 = 0.1^5. Thus, by inclusion-exclusion, answer (b) is correct.
